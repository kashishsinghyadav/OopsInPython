The word object-oriented is the combination of two words i.e. object and oriented. The dictionary meaning of the object is an article or entity that exists in the real world
where class is blue print of an object

It is the most popular programming model among developers. 
It is well suited for programs that are large, complex, and actively updated or maintained. 
It simplifies software development and maintenance by providing major concepts such as abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.
 These core concepts support OOP.

Points to Remember
Everything is an object
Developer manipulates objects that uses message passing.
Every object is an instance of a class.
The class contains the attribute and behavior associated with an object.
